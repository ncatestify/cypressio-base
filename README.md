# TESTIFY.TEAM template to start Cypress.IO website testing

![TESTIFY-Logo-horizontal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108877931/213471758-3fa5694f-2b6f-4c1d-9161-26b512fe3968.jpg)

[TESTIFY.TEAM](https://testify.team) - WE FIND BUGS. **AUTOMATED**.

Errors are often in the details. Finding bugs manually can be like searching in a digital haystack: You waste time and resources. Automated website testing reduces both. At the same time, it increases the effectiveness and security of your application. TESTIFY is your agency for automated website testing.

## Installation

Initialize a new repo

```bash
$ npm init with ncatestify/cypressio-base

$ npm install

### Never Code Alone

We believe in open source and software craftsmanship. All our work, trainings and settings are public. We want to build better working conditions for developer and help out of legacy hells.

This is important for our mental health. **AUTOMATE ALL THE THINGS** is the first step to escape to a mindful live.
